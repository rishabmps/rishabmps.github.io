# Hello!

A lot of my friends have blogs, why not me too? I explain a bit more on my [Hello World]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-03-07-hello-world %}) post, so probably read that first.

This blog may contain content on photography, machining, coding, baking, cooking, MIT, or anything else I decide is interesting. Feel free to follow along :)

## Me

I'm Landon, but you probably already knew that. I graduated from MIT in 2017 and am finishing my M-Eng in 2018. In the fall I'll be moving to NYC to work at Palantir.

I've also got a list of some of the [projects]({{ '/projects' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) I've worked on.

## Some technical stuff/"colophon"

I really like the Colophon section in [Technique](technique.mit.edu), which lists a bunch of historical/technical things. I'm probably the only one that actually reads it, but that's fine. (Disclaimer: I don't guarantee to keep this up to date).

Shutter Clicks is my personal site/blog. I use my block-style watermark as the favicon, which I created in (probably?) 2015, and usually watermark photos with in the bottom-left corner.

Shutter Clicks is a static [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The [source code](https://github.com/lycarter/lycarter.github.com/) is on my public github (for now).

Headings are typeset in [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto), and body text is typeset in [Libre Baskerville](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville). The footer and other secondary serif text is typeset in [Palantino](https://www.linotype.com/57056/palatino-linotype-family.html), and monospace text is typeset in [Menlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_(typeface)).

Most of these were the default values included with [Tale](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale/), the Jekyll theme I have adapted for Shutter Clicks.
