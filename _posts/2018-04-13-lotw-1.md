A few days ago I came across a really cool article from the NY Times tech team about [building a custom text editor](https://open.nytimes.com/building-a-text-editor-for-a-digital-first-newsroom-f1cb8367fc21). I wanted to share it with a few friends, and thought that a list of interesting links & commentary might make a good blog post. It might also be a good way for me to just archive my own thoughts and internet snippets I find interesting. Here goes:

- [Building a Text Editor for a Digital-First Newsroom](https://open.nytimes.com/building-a-text-editor-for-a-digital-first-newsroom-f1cb8367fc21): Article by the NY Times tech team about building a custom text editor for their writers and editors. It talks about a lot of cool technical challenges, and is a generally interesting article as someone who recently started a blog, and was recently thinking about editing vs display, what aspects of WYSIWYG I enjoyed and which ones I wish would go away.
- [Gaze & Foot Placement When Walking Over Rough Terrain](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/8bzdr8/gaze_and_foot_placement_when_walking_over_rough/): r/dataisbeautiful post by a researcher that's just a really cool visualization of exactly the title. Vision tracking is a pretty interesting proxy for human attention and processing. Here's also the [full article](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(18)30309-9), which I haven't read.
- [3D Printer Timelapse Software](https://hackaday.com/2018/04/13/3d-printer-time-lapse-videos-ditch-the-blur/): Software for Octoprint which ensures photos are taken at specific extruder positions, which results in a cleaner/more magical video. Also, a [direct link](https://github.com/FormerLurker/Octolapse) to the project. I'll file this into future projects, if I ever get a 3d printer.
- [DIY espressobin router](https://blog.tjll.net/building-my-perfect-router/): Another "future project" idea, this guy set up a router from scratch, and seems to get good performance for pretty cheap. The other bonus is that it's not resistant to lots of the bugs and exploits normal routers are.
- [Nightcore - How to Be a Heartbreaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6NvsM49N6w): Rachel introduced me to Nightcore this week. That's all.

I didn't start saving links til yesterday, so I'll hopefully have more next week? Thanks for reading!
