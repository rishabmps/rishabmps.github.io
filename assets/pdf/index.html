	<h1>Project Listing</h1>
<br>
	<h2>Research</h2>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="3DPrintableRobotics.pdf">Computational Design for 3D Printable Robotics</a> - a SuperUROP project to close the loop on robot design, allowing robots to be designed automatically for 3D printing. I worked on this during Fall '16 and will continue work in Spring '17.</li>
	<li><a href="LandonCarterMOF5.pdf">Cation Exchange in MOF-5</a> - a UROP project from Spring '14.</li>
	<li><a href="MCM.pdf">Brownie Pan Design</a> - a mathematical modeling project for MCM '13. We won a Meritorious ranking (~top 20%).</li>
	<li><a href="HiMCM.pdf">Elk Population Modeling</a> - a mathematical modeling project for HiMCM '12. We won a Finalist ranking (~top 10%).</li>
	<li><a href="BCS_ranking.pdf">College Football Ranking</a> - our mathematical modeling final project from Fall '12.</li>
	<li><a href="MOF_Porphyrin.pdf">MOFs for Cancer Therapy</a> - my Siemens/Intel/ISEF project from Summer '12. I won Siemens Semifinalist, Intel STS Semifinalist, and ISEF 3rd place in Chemistry.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Class Projects</h2>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="Curved_Creases.pdf">6.849 Final Project</a> - For my final project for Geometric Folding Algorithms, I explored curved crease origami in semi-rigid materials, focusing on developing a software package to produce waterjet-cuttable files for perforating sheet metal for folding. I took this class Spring '17.</li>
	<li><a href="033_Gigabus.pdf">6.033 Final Project</a> - For my final project for Computer System Engineering, our team of 3 was tasked with redesigning the MBTA bus scheduling system. I concentrated on the bandwidth utilization scheme. I took this class Spring '17.</li>
	<li><a href="http://web.mit.edu/2.009/2016/orange.pdf">2.009 Final Project</a> - 2.009 is MIT's MechE capstone class, so I led a team of 18 students to design, build, and <a href="http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www/interestMedia/final/final2016/orange.html">present to an audience of 1200+</a> an alpha prototype of a speech-enabled respirator. I also led design of the electronics for the respirator, including 3 custom PCB's to power, filter, and amplify the microphone. I took this class Fall '16.</li>
	<li><a href="lightsaberTraining.pdf">6.111 Final Project</a> - For my final project for Digital Systems Laboratory, our team of 3 created an interactive augmented reality game on a Virtex-2 FPGA where players could hold a "lightsaber handle" and hit sprites onscreen, similar to fruit Ninja. I took this class Fall '16.</li>
	<li><a href="GPs_videoAnalysis.pdf">6.882 Final Project</a> - For my final project for Bayesian Inference, I implemented Heteroscedastic Gaussian Processes and tried to look at some applications in video reconstruction. I took this class Spring '16.</li>
	<li><a href="nikonLenses.pdf">2.671 Final Project</a> - For my Go Forth project in Measurement and Instrumentation, I investigated optical performance of a photographic lens by measuring its step response and calculating the transfer function. I took this class Spring '16.</li>
	<li><a href="featureSelection_imageClassification.pdf">6.867 Final Project</a> - For my final project for Machine Learning, with a partner, I mixed and matched various feature selection methods with various classification and clustering algorithms, looking at their performance in image classification on CIFAR-10. I took this class Fall '15.</li>
	<li><a href="Ball_and_Bob.pdf">2.086 Final Project</a> - For my final project for Numerical Computation, I looked at parameter fitting and sensitivity analysis for differential systems of motion. I took this class Fall '14</li>
	</ul>
  <h2>Big Projects</h2>
 	<ul>
	<li><a href=http://combat-robotics.mit.edu/buildlog/>The Dentist</a> - a 250 lb combat robot I built with a small team of friends for our entry in Battlebots Season 2. We ran into some controller issues and unfortunately couldn't compete, but I learned a lot that will be applied towards an entry in Season 3. For The Dentist, I worked on the concept, mechanical design, CAD, and all of the machining. Blog posts still under construction.</li>
  <li><a href="http://lcarter.mit.edu/blog/archives/19">Frozen Chainsaw Massacre</a> - a go-kart I built with a small team of friends for the Power Racing Series. We ran into some reliability issues in Detroit, but have high hopes for a good showing at the New York Maker Faire. I worked mostly on the steering geometry, CAD, and machining.</li>
  <li><a href="http://d3nigma.herokuapp.com">D3NIGMA</a> - a website I worked on for 6.148, MIT's web programming competition. We were awarded best frontend design and honorable mention overall. I worked primarily on front-end, as well as UI/UX design.</li>
  <li><a href="http://mellow-d.mit.edu">Mellow-D</a> - a website I worked on for HackMIT. We were awarded best hack for social good and the Quirky sponsor prize. I worked primarily on database generation and seeding.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Small Projects</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="http://lcarter.mit.edu/unread">Unread Emails</a> - a webpage displaying the results of a cron script I wrote, which logs and graphs my unread emails.</li>
