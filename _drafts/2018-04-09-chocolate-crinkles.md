I've gotten into cooking and baking this year with some additional free time, and Safetyfourth's well-stocked kitchen. My parents also got me a couple of cookbooks for Christmas. Here's a recipe for Chocolate Crinkles, modified from the Betty Crocker Cookbook:

## Chocolate Crinkle Cookies
(makes about 3 dozen cookies)

### Ingredients:

- 2 cups granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 2 tsp vanilla
- 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 4 eggs
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 cup powdered sugar

### Directions:

1. In large bowl, stir granulated sugar, oil, vanilla, and cocoa powder until well mixed. Stir in eggs, one at a time. Stir in flour, baking powder, and salt. Cover and refrigerate at least 3 hours.
2. Heat oven to 350 Â°F. Grease cookie sheets with shortening or cooking spray, or line with cooking parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
3. In small bowl, place powdered sugar. Shape dough into 1-inch balls, and drop into powdered sugar; roll around to coat thoroughly. On cookie sheets, place balls about 2 inches apart.
4. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until almost no indentation remains when touched in center. Immediately remove from cookie sheets to cooling racks.

The first time I tried this recipe, I followed the original recipe, which called for baker's chocolate instead of cocoa powder. Baker's chocolate has a much higher fat content, which resulted in a cookie that was too oily/gritty. I also unknowingly used baking powder that was expired by about 18 months, so the cookies didn't rise at all. Other people liked them, but I was disappointed, and decided to try again.

On my second (and all subsequent) attempts, I modified the recipe with cocoa powder, and bought new baking powder. The cookies rose beautifully and were crunchy on the outside and chewy in the middle. They also looked great - enjoy :)
