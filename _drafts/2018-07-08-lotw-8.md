Hm, this is turning into links every other week. Oh well. I read a lot about networking this week in anticipation of upgrading my storage server to computer link to 10 Gb, or I might even try 40 Gb infiniband. I also read a lot about RF, linked from a series of Defcon talks I watched. It would be really cool to grab satellite images and archive them - that seems like it would be a reasonable use of my secondary storage server.

## Networking
- [Homelab setup for HA Internet](https://github.com/bradfitz/homelab): A lot of HN comments complained that for internet/networking, simpler is usually more robust/reliable, but it's an interesting thought experiment anyway.
- [40 Gb IB from LTT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAks6qM9jlM): Filled with Linus' annoying-ness, but is a good enough guide to using IB for Windows networking.
- [10 Gb Tips from LTT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D03t890dKTU): For actually tuning the link to provide good real-world performance.
- [Comprehensive Review/Guide to UniFi gear](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/07/enterprise-wi-fi-at-home-part-two-reflecting-on-almost-three-years-with-pro-gear/): UniFi gear is very popular among the homelab crowd when people buy new - for used gear, most people make do with old gear that's probably more capable but with a less-intuitive UI.
- [Reddit roundup of affordable used 10G switches](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/81cdwc/what_are_the_options_for_cheap_10g_sfp_switches/?st=jj9j9n1q&sh=b306325e): Lots of good links here and possible new saved eBay searches...


## RF
- [Feature extraction from aerial/satellite imagery](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17470118): The title pretty much sums it up, but Mapbox open-sourced some code for feature extraction. Sadly they haven't released the pre-trained models yet, a decision explained in the HN comments.
- [DIY 2.4 GHz Radio Telescope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3LT_b6K0Mc&feature=youtu.be): I've thought of making one of these, but I might make it in the actual radio telescope wavelengths. It might even wind up being more affordable than an optical telescope. I'd probably experiment with phased multi-receiver setups so I can adjust the aperture.
- [Defcon general RF overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuNOD3XWp4A): A talk which discusses, among other things, decoding airplane transmissions. There was also a raspberry pi project for [flightaware tracking](https://hackaday.com/2015/07/18/tracking-nearly-every-aircraft-with-a-raspberry-pi/) (via [LOTW 6]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-12-lotw-6 %})).
- [Guide to satellite image capture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jukobjB46gQ): Goes through an [instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-NOAA-Weather-Satellite-Receiver/) with a guide to receiving from NOAA satellites and automatically scheduling things.

## Sensors
- [Simple solar cell + battery for distributed sensing](https://hackaday.com/2018/07/08/ultra-low-power-energy-harvesting-battery-charger/): A reasonably integrated, low-BOM system that can supply 1.8 mA average current off of about 6 hours of sunlight a day. Seems very well-paired to distributed sensors.
- [Fancy, high-precision temperature sensor](https://hackaday.com/2018/06/28/move-aside-mercury-measuring-temperature-accurately-with-an-rtd/): This article also gives a chip, the [MAX31865](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/sensors/MAX31865.html), which is designed to read off the RTD modules really easily.

## Watches
I at one point decided it would be a fun idea to make a watch, but never followed through with it. I never planned to make the internals, but would make the body, crown, and possibly face. I haven't really given up that dream, but after doing research, it faded into "ok, I've done the base research, the rest is just slogging through the design, manufacture, and polishing of everything" which is always a lot less exciting. This past two weeks I discovered some new videos that may inspire me to take that project back up...
- [3D printed 3-axis tourbillion](https://hackaday.com/2018/06/30/gyrotourbillion-blesses-the-eyes-hard-to-say/): I want to print this. Maybe someday I'll even be able to actually make a metal one...probably not for a watch, but maybe a fancy desk clock.
- [It's all about workmanship](http://nickhacko.blogspot.com/2018/06/its-all-about-workmanship.html): An inspiring post by an Australian horologist.
- [Handcrafted watch with new complication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1moRfIXCfak): An amazingly beautiful 40 minute documentary about a Japanese independent watchmaker.
- [Building a custom watch with eBay parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDfde-nmtKg): The much cheaper, less time-intensive alternative.

## Tech
- [Competitive iPhone teardowns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx-9LkVIdz0): I knew there was a semi-competitive iPhone jailbreaking community, but didn't know there was also a competitive iPhone teardown community.
- [Tariffs make parts more expensive](https://hackaday.com/2018/07/02/electronics-manufacturers-react-to-china-trade-tariffs/): Again, title sums it up, but the tariffs are not written in a way that encourages US manufacturing/assembly. Individual components are taxed, but assembled units are not, or are taxed less.
- [Superiority, by Arthur Clarke](http://www.mayofamily.com/RLM/txt_Clarke_Superiority.html): A very pointed short story that discusses feature bloat vs robustness.
- [Profiting off of penny stock spam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytDamqTjPwg): A Defcon talk which reminded me of James Veitch's TED talk on [replying to spammers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdPW8JrYzQ).
- [NanoPi-Fire3 cluster](https://climbers.net/sbc/nanopi-fire3-arm-supercomputer/): The cluster itself is nice enough, but what's really interesting is the NanoPi-Fire3, which is basically an 8-core Raspberry Pi for about the same price. Also notable is that it has a 1 gig ethernet port instead of the 100 Mb port of the Raspberry Pi.
- [A 2 Hour YouTube video on cabling overhaul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amdfzcqaTIQ): The video covers overhauling the ethernet installation in a small/medium-sized office building, and all of the work associated with that. Of course there's plenty of [r/cableporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/cableporn/) material here, but it's also a prime example of a [recent xkcd](https://xkcd.com/2012/).


As always, thanks for reading! :)
