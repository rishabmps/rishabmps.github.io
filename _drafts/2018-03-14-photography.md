### I like taking photos.

### I like cameras.

### I like photography.

These 3 statements may seem to be the same, or at least obviously correlated with one another, but I don't think they necessarily are. Let's break it down.


## I like taking photos.

This one is pretty straightforward - I enjoy taking photos. I enjoy taking photos of lots of things - landscapes, events, dance, people...

![TODO](https://placehold.it/800x600 "TODO")

I classify artists and photographers into different buckets - artists are people that intend to create something, and may use photography as a process towards that goal. Photographers see things and take photos of them - they're more opportunistic. This doesn't mean there's no crossover or in-between (there certainly is), but I place myself further on the "photographer" side of the spectrum than "artist". I usually take pictures of things because they're nice looking, or I want to remember them, or it just caught my eye. Sometimes, I go out with the intention of creating something specific, but instances of that are relatively rare. The best example would be my photo of [Kedi](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1404442466234459&set=a.1404442366234469.1073741939.100000061561346&type=3&theater) from [MIT in Flight](https://arts.mit.edu/start/wiesner-student-art-gallery/past-exhibitions/) (I should probably put up a virtual version of the gallery at some point...)

## I like cameras.

This one is also pretty straightforward - cameras are cool. Digital cameras have absurdly good light sensitivity and precision, optics require tons of numerical simulation to optimize, and old mechanical cameras are similar to watches in their mechanical complexity and precision. Different cameras are designed for different use cases and have different styles. Different lenses can completely distort your view of the world.

 More frequently than going out looking for specific subjects, I'll go out with a specific lens and find subjects opportunistically that work with that particular lens. The world looks very different at 14mm or at 200mm, or f/1.4.

I did a whole project on optical performance of lenses **TODO: link report**, and [Roger's writeups](https://wordpress.lensrentals.com/blog/category/geek-articles/) on LensRentals are absolutely fascinating. I may be the only person you know that actually reads [MTF charts](https://luminous-landscape.com/mtf/) and wishes for _more_ data, and I may also be the only person you know that reads sensor datasheets (the other being one of my friends, [Bayley](http://isopack.blogspot.com/)).

Why the fascination? I'm an engineer, so I appreciate the engineering that goes into cameras and lenses. I appreciate the machining, the manufacturing process, and the hand-tuning. There are few things more pleasant-feeling than a perfectly-damped focus ring from an old manual-focus lens. Before continuing too much farther, appreciate the tactility of film from the opening sequence of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mydIbgAQ_OA), and then come back.

Beyond an engineering interest, there's an element of collectorism to it. There's something a perfect about a single-stroke rewind lever, so I absolutely adore my [Minolta SRT-100](https://www.japancamerahunter.com/2016/05/camera-geekery-minolta-srt-100x-review/). There's also something a little magical about film - more poetic sorts might drone on about the "analog feel" or "film aesthetic", and as much as I hate that sort of verbiage, they're not wrong - color slide film on a light table is magical. With a large format slide, you can take a loupe and inspect every part of it, each part revealing new secrets, and there's a distinct intentionality of reviewing film versus reviewing digital photos.

## I like photography.

This one is probably the hardest to explain. To many people, photography and taking pictures are the same thing. To me, they're not. Taking pictures is only a small part of photography - photography is the process of producing an image. Referring back to the "artist vs photographer" tangent above, photography and art bear a lot of resemblences, but again, photography is more reactive. I would generally classify photography as:

1. Selecting a camera, lens, and accessories
2. Taking a photo
3. Editing that photo
4. Archiving the data & publishing the image
<!-- 5. Publishing the image -->

**Selecting a camera** is usually an offhand gesture - use whatever's at hand, or whatever camera is the best you can get your hands on. This becomes an important step of the process only when there's choices involved - which camera to use, which lens to use. Making sure that the battery is charged and the SD card is formatted (or that there's a fresh roll of film loaded). For 2.009, we had such a problem with this that I made a specialized mat to hold all of our chargers and batteries.

**Taking a photo**...I went into this in more detail above. This is "photography" for most people, but it definitely doesn't end here.

**Editing a photo** is arguably the step that separates "professional" photographers from "amateur" photographers or "good" from "bad", but editing is the process that refines whatever I saw when taking a photo. Editing involves selecting just a few photos from a set of many, perhaps organizing them in a particular way to emphasize relationships, or just add visual interest. Editing also involves perfecting each individual photo, bringing out all of the details, accentuating parts that should be highlighted, and masking parts that don't need to be there. Editing adds a style to the photo beyond just the style the photo was taken in. At this point in my life, I refuse to publish or even really let anyone see my unedited photos, because an unedited photo is not the full realization of me as a photographer.

**Archiving the data & publishing the image**. I have a very extensive archival system of multiple backups, many hard drives, and an extremely rigorous folder structure for organizing photos. I'll probably do a post on that itself at some later point, but suffice to say, I can dig up any image I've taken since I started taking photos in 2006. Publishing the image can also be an interesting one - for me, this usually consists of exporting a jpg album and posting it on Facebook. Every now and then, I'll print a photo, and for 2.009/2.744, I post albums onto the course website.

Photography isn't just taking pictures or liking cameras - it's the whole process.
