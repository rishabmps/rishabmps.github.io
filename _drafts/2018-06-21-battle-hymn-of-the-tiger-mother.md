These trends are common among first- and second-generation Asian-Americans and in many first- or second-generation Americans whose parents immigrated from (usually) a country with fewer opportunities, who had less education, less money, etc, but worked hard to get where they are today. I'm not Asian-American, and both of my parents have had family living in the US for generations back, so on the surface it seems like these themes might not apply. However, some of the similar situations apply - my mom's parents were not wealthy growing up, and her grandparents were minimally educated. Both of her parents worked unbelievably hard to achieve success, and instilled that in my mom, who in turn raised me with similar expectations.
