Second in my regular (?) series, here's some things I found this week that I thought were cool and wanted to share:

- [6 Layered Chocolate Mousse Cake](https://www.allasyummyfood.com/chocolate-moussecake): Fancy chocolate cake that I want to bake sometime. Look at the pretty pictures!

- [Rotary Encoders Become I2C Devices](https://hackaday.com/2018/04/15/rotary-encoders-become-i2c-devices/): Hackaday article featuring a project to very simply/cheaply daisy-chain rotary encoders. I could see this being useful for making an improved [Loupedeck](https://loupedeck.com/) (it's useful, but the buttons and dials feel kinda cheap).

- [Making the Captain's Quarters: Ship Shop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TKTrAW1QIY): Latest video from Brett McAfee. He's a maker that works with [Diresta](https://www.youtube.com/user/jimmydiresta), but IMO actually makes cooler things and better videos, but only has 11k subs vs Diresta's 1.2M.

- [False Color Night Sky Images Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/8cjcv1/the_differences_between_false_color_and_true/?st=jg26laze&sh=3e5360e3): Interesting notes in a Reddit comment about galaxy emission spectra and using false-color photographs. I feel like astrophotography as a hobby would be right up my alley, if only there were dark skies nearby.

- [Probability Theory (For Scientists and Engineers)](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/probability_theory.html): Awesome math resource for probability. This would have been great to have back when I was taking 6.867 and 6.882.

- [Japanese Take on American Sushi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgiu9cqph5Y): Another great cooking video, by a channel I actually hadn't found before, [Jun's Kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/user/JunsKitchen). I'd found his [co-channel with Rachel](https://www.youtube.com/user/MyHusbandisJapanese), but didn't wind up subscribing at the time - the cooking channel is great though!

- [NYC Subway History](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/04/why-new-york-city-stopped-building-subways/557567/): Fascinating article on NYC subway history. Lots of politics involved, and it explains some of why things are the way they are currently.

- [NAB Highlights from LensRentals](https://www.lensrentals.com/blog/2018/04/ten-products-that-caught-our-attention-at-nab-2018/): I don't do a lot of video any more, and all of the equipment here is video gear, but that [Blackmagic 4k camera](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicpocketcinemacamera) looks pretty sweet.

- [Portrait on 500px](https://500px.com/photo/253999827/i-left-my-heart-in-hong-kong-by-justin-lim): I follow some photo blogs, and this shot just caught my eye.

- [Japanese Interior Design](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoomPorn/comments/8dvhgs/nojiriko_nature_platforms_sugawaradaisuke_japan/?st=jg9yaao5&sh=5b6dd728):  Just a random interesting bit of interior design. Some of the comments are pretty relevant about how not-practical it is, but it still looks interesting.

Thanks for reading!
